<p>Beautiful animation and amazing storytelling. Flin Rider is so funny and I just love how we get to see Rapunzel
finally experience the real world and find her parents. Truly a beautiful movie!</p>

<p>By this list you probably think I'm a child lol. No but I will say I love my childhood movies very much and this
movie completely changed my opinion on Ben 10. I used to think Ben 10 was a really bad show just because I had
other interests, but the 3d animation in this movie is unforgettable. If you're every looking for a movie that
will feel nostalgic and captivating, this is the one for you!</p>

    since we're already on the top of childhood movies, I might as well throw this one in. Gnomeo and Juliet
    was one of my favourite movies ever. As a child, I would watch this movie everyday after school. I even
    started saying the lines of the characters as I watched it. Eventually I got tired of it but it will always
    be a core memory!

    I hope you enjoyed this ranking! I should've named this the best childhood movie ranking but, tha's 
    a completely different list. I would definitely have barbie movies on there somewhere lol. Thanks for reading!
